# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Real2Virtual


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Jerry Bernard  - Albertian Institute Of Science and Technology(aisat)
- Member 2: Alan Verghese Mathew - Albertian Institute Of Science and Technolgy(aisat)


### Project Description
The project is used to depict body tracking and movement replication.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Depiction on how body works or the wave flows in it.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Shows the angle of flexiblity of the body systems and joints and to replicate it with a skeletal systems.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Open cv
- Unity
- Python
- c#

For Hardware:
-
- Laptop
- Camera to capture the videos

### Implementation
For Software:Installation of unity,vs code(open cv) 
# Installation
vs code,unity..

# Run
python,git

### Project Documentation
For Software: Github

This image show how the skeletal replicates the position and movements of the human body with help of coordinates

Working in C#





### Project Demo
# Video
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gaaR7-y6OYK5FNeP5EKOPZRf2evJM6IS/view?usp=drive_link
The video demonstrates how the human body with its marked coordinates with change in position leading to movement of body systems can be reciprocated into skeletal system.

# Additional Demos
[Add any extra demo materials/links]

## Team Contributions
- Name 1: Jerry Bernard - Dealt with opencv and coordiante mapping then implementing it with unity to the skeletal system.
- Name 2: Alan Verghese Mathew-suggested changes in the projrct making tried out options it unity and submission process in github.
